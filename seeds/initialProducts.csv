The original production ended in 1961 with Gibson only making 1,700 of these instruments. That makes this edition all the more desirable. Finished in breathtaking Tri-Burst, this Les Paul Standard features a mahogany body topped with AA grade flame maple. Powered by dual Burstbuckers with period-correct orange drop caps, it's a perfect guitar for players who want a classic Les Paul without having to pay a vintage price.","a872a473-1ae1-4897-b0bb-23dfdac5be24"
