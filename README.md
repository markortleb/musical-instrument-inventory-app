# Musical Instrument Inventory App

An app to manage inventory at a musical instrument store.


## Connecting to a database

To connect to a Mongo DB database, do the following:

1. Create a file called `db_conn_info/db_conn_info.json`. *This file will not be tracked by git.*
2. In the `db_conn_info/` directory, copy the contents from the `db_conn_info.sample.json` file
to your newly created `db_conn_info.json` file. Change placeholder values to the real database
connection values.
